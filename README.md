## How to Play

In this version the user tries to find and sink five battleships of varying sizes before their ammunition runs out! The board has a vertical axis of A to J and a horizontal axis of 0 to 9 with wave icons concealing the battleship locations. The user pinpoints where they wish to strike by choosing one point from each axis, for example ‘B7’. If the user has hit an area on a battleship, the wave icon is replaced by the ‘X’ symbol. If they have missed, the wave symbol is replaced by the ‘!’ symbol. The user has 60 rounds of ammunition which equals 60 tries. 

When a user misses, a message in the terminal reads “Shot missed, no battleship was hit.”

When a user strikes a part of a battleship, a message in terminal reads “Battleship was hit!”

When all points of a battleship are hit, a message in the terminal reads “Hit!!! Battleship destroyed!!!”
